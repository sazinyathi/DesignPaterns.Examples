Decoractor Pattern
This pattern demostrate how the state of change can be publish to client.
eg. WeatherStation will be responsible to publish a new tempature to WindowPhone Application.
There is an Observable and Observor.
The Observable Interface will have the following functons or algorithims
   void Add(IObserver observer)
   Void Remove(IObserver observer)
   Void Notify();
The weatherContrict Class will implement the IObservable Interface
The weatherContrict Class will have a GetTempeture()

The Observor Interface will have the following functions
    void Update();
The windowPhoneContrict Class will implement the IObserver Interface.
